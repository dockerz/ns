second attempt

restful lamp api and administration pages for new scribbler.

to do:

  generate codes for each user -- find what schema looks like from chris
  
  individual user page tabs and interactions
  
    add & remove issues
    
    view code(s)
    

questions:

  for users who have access to issues 1-126, will they also have access to any forthcoming issues in perpetuity?
